Other Licence Prefixes are defined in the ""Commercial Licence Types (Licence Prefixes)"" Reference Data report."
LICENCE ROOT,Unique number distinguishing this Licence from other Licences with the same Licence Prefix.
LICENCE SUFFIX,"Fishing year or season to which the Licence applies.  If the season spans more than one calendar year, then the first calendar year is used.  For example, the ""2014/2015"" season would have a Suffix of ""2014""."
LICENCE TAB,"Licence Tab is the concatenation of the Licence Prefix, Root and Suffix. For example, ""L 411 2014"" translates to the Halibut Fishery, licence number 411 in the 2014/2015 season."

LIEL_SEQ,"Licence Eligibility Sequence.  This identifier is used to track the eligibility to have a Licence in a limited entry fishery.

For example, all licences issued to T 10 in any season (i.e. T 10 2014, T 10 2013, T 10 2012, etc.) will have the same LIEL_SEQ.  This value can be very helpful in tracking the history of a Licence.
